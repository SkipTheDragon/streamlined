# Use Cases

The "Streamlined" platform, as we've been discussing, offers a plethora of features that make it versatile for a variety of use cases. Here are a few examples:

1. **Documentation Assistance**: Companies with complex software products can use Streamlined to create direct links within their documentation to specific parts of their software, making it easier for users to understand and apply what they're learning in real-time.

2. **Customer Support**: Customer support teams can leverage the platform to guide users directly to the areas they're having trouble with, or to demonstrate how to use certain features. This could significantly reduce the amount of time spent on support calls or emails.

3. **Software Onboarding**: For companies that offer complex software solutions, Streamlined can play a crucial role in the onboarding process. By using direct links to guide users through the setup process, new users can become proficient more quickly.

4. **Technical Training**: In technical training scenarios, trainers can use Streamlined to create a structured, step-by-step process for learners, guiding them directly to the features or areas of the software they're learning about.

5. **Privacy-Sensitive Environments**: For organizations or individuals who are very concerned about privacy, the fact that Streamlined stores all data locally in the user's browser is a huge advantage. This feature can be leveraged in scenarios where data privacy is of utmost importance.

6. **Web Development**: Given its compatibility with Symfony and its extensibility, Streamlined can be an ideal tool for web developers looking to create complex projects or integrate additional functionality into existing Symfony projects.

Remember, the value of Streamlined is its ability to simplify navigation and usage of complex software or platforms, so any scenario where ease-of-use and efficiency are important could potentially benefit from this platform.

## Quick Examples


Let's say you want your users to create a token from Envato API's with predefined permissions.

Instead of giving them a link to the [Envato API's](https://build.envato.com/api/) and asking them to create a token with the following permissions:
- View and search Envato sites
- Download the user's purchased items
- List purchases the user has made
- etc.

You could just give them a streamlined link:
https://build.envato.com/create-token/?default=t&purchase:download=t&purchase:list=t

Or, let's say you want to show your users how to create a new user in WordPress.

Instead of guiding them through the following steps:
1. Go to the WordPress admin panel.
2. Click on the "Users" tab.
3. Click on the "Add New" button.
4. Enter the user's information.
5. Click the "Add New User" button.
6. etc.

You could just give them a streamlined link:
https://example.com/wp-admin/user-new.php?user_login=USERNAME&user_email=EMAIL&first_name=FIRSTNAME&last_name=LASTNAME&url=WEBSITE&pass1=PASSWORD&pass2=PASSWORD

Once they filled out the Instance url with their website there will be fewer steps to follow and less room for error. Meaning you will have fewer support tickets to deal with.
