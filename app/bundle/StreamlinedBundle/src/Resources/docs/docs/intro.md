In case you are a new customer of ours, you should know this little trick, so you can get the most out of our products:

Our website is built using the following structure: `https://<product-name>.<action>.wyverr.com`. 
So, for example, if you want to see the roadmap of our product named `Streamlined` you should go to `https://streamlined.roadmap.wyverr.com`. 

In case the product name/action has multiple words, you should replace the spaces with dashes. For example, if you want to see the demo of our product named `Cool App Bundle` you should go to `https://cool-app-bundle.demo.wyverr.com`.

The available actions are:
- `docs` - The documentation of the product.
- `demo` - The demo of the product.
- `purchase` - Where to purchase the product from.
- `changelog` - The changelog of the product.
- `roadmap` - The roadmap of the product.
