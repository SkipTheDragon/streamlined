# What you'll need

It's pretty simple to get started with Streamlined. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to get started with Streamlined so we have split the requirements into two categories: **Required** and **Optional**.

## Required

- [PHP 8.1 or newer](https://www.php.net/) - Streamlined is built using PHP, so you need to have PHP installed on your machine. (We recommend using the latest version of PHP.)
- [A Web Server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9484453-8H) - We recommend getting one from [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9484453-8H)*. Register using our referral code and get $100 credit to grow your business.
- These PHP extensions (which are installed and enabled by default in most PHP 8 installations, not to worry if using [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9484453-8H)): Ctype, iconv, PCRE, Session, SimpleXML, and Tokenizer;

## Optional

- [Symfony 6 or newer](https://symfony.com/) - An existing Symfony project, in case you want to use the product as a bundle. **(Not required if you use the "Ready To Use" package.)**
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Streamlined is built using Composer, so you need to have Composer installed on your machine. **(Not required if you use the "Ready To Use" package.)**
